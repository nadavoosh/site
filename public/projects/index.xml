      <description>Ask Metafilter is a fantastic community Q-and-A site. Sometimes (often!) people ask questions that result in a long list of song recommendations. In these threads, I always wanted a way to convert the &amp;ldquo;hive mind&amp;rdquo; recommendations into a spotify playlist.
The metafilter comments can be links to YouTube, album names, or a story about one particular performance &amp;ndash; anything, really.
This page takes an AskMetaFilter URL as an input, parses the responses to try to identify song recommendations, and searches spotify for those recommendations.</description>

      <description>Our clock divides the day into two 12-hour halves.
Obviously, 12 was a fundamental number for many ancient civilizations, which gave us our 12 hour days and nights.
I wondered what our clocks would look like if that number was different. What if we had 11 hour days? or 24 hour days? Or 37 hour days? With 11 hours, the differences are subtle but drive the clock into uncanny-valley territory, which is territory I like exploring.</description>
