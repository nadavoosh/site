Our clock divides the day into two 12-hour halves.

Obviously, 12 was an important number for many ancient civilizations, which gave us our 12 hour days and nights.

I wondered what our clocks would look like if that number was different. What if we had [11 hour clocks](https://nadavrec.ca/eleventhour)? or [24 hour clocks](https://nadavrec.ca/eleventhour#24)? Or [37 hour clocks](https://nadavrec.ca/eleventhour#37)? With 11 hours, the differences are subtle but drive the clock into uncanny-valley territory, which is territory I like exploring.

You can generate a clock with any arbitrary number of hours by changing the number after the hash sign [here](https://nadavrec.ca/eleventhour#11). The default is 11.
