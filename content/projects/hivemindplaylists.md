[Ask Metafilter](https://ask.metafilter.com/) is a fantastic community Q-and-A site. Sometimes (often!) people ask questions that result in a long list of song recommendations. In these threads, I always wanted a way to convert the "hive mind" recommendations into a spotify playlist.

The metafilter comments can be links to YouTube, album names, or a story about one particular performance -- anything, really.

[This page](https://nadavrecca.com/hivemindplaylists) takes an AskMetaFilter URL as an input, parses the responses to try to identify song recommendations, and searches spotify for those recommendations.

The result is a spotify playlist generated by the ask metafilter post.

When the question was actually about songs, this ususally produces a playlist of the "right" flavor. When the question was about something else entirely, the playlist is too.

You can save the resulting spotify playlist for easy listening :)
