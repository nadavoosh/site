I am Nadav Recca.

I live in San Francisco, California and I like to watch sunrises & sunsets.

I also spend time forcing my bike up big hills, forcing my brain to speak new languages, and forcing computers to do things.

That's about all the forcing I like to do in life, though. The rest is just riding the earth.

I would love for you [to say hi](mailto:nadav@nadavrec.ca).
