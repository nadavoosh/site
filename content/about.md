I am Nadav Recca.

I live in San Francisco, California and I like to watch sunrises & sunsets.

I like to read poetry outloud to friends. Sometimes I write poetry too, but that's just to try it out.

And I also spend time forcing my bike up big hills, forcing my brain to speak new languages, and forcing computers to do things.

That's about all the forcing I like to do in life, though. The rest is coasting.

I would love for you [to say hi to me](mailto:ami@nadavrec.ca).
